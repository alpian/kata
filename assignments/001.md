## Basics

### Addition
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 5 3" which is 8.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 9 1" which is 10.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 12 6" which is 18.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 1 2 3" which is 6.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 1 2 3 4" which is 10.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 1 2 ... n" which can contain any number of integers. The result guaranteed to be lower than Long.MAX_VALUE.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 5 -1" which is 4.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ 5 +1" which is 6.
 - Interpreter should return the result of "+ m0 ...mN" where mI can be positive (not prefixed or prefixed with +) or negative (prefixed with -).
 
### Subtraction
 - Interpreter should return the result of "- 5 3" which is 2.
